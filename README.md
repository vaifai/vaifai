## 💼 About Me

I'm a software engineer with **6+ years of experience** working across product-based companies like **Amazon**, **Salesforce** and **Airbnb**. My core strengths lie in **backend development, deployment of LLMs and building applications for search relevancy using Opensearch and RAG**.

🔧 Currently, I’m focusing on building **high-throughput infra systems**, and learning how to design and train **LLMs from scratch**. I’m especially interested in **AI agents, the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and how emerging LLM technologies can be used for real-world automation and productivity.
